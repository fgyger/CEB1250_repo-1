# What is the difference between ‘HAVING’ CLAUSE and a ‘WHERE’ CLAUSE

# For DDL language use case with a SELECT statement, when agregation is not used, the 'WHERE' CLAUSE is used. Within an aggregation statement, the 'HAVING' CLAUSE is used.

# [2] Ref.: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/287474/whats-the-difference-between-having-and-where
# "HAVING: is used to check conditions after the aggregation takes place. WHERE: is used to check conditions before the aggregation takes place." 



# List, and explain the elements of an Entities and Relationships model

# [3] Ref.: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dbms/er_model_basic_concepts.htm
# "Mapping Cardinalities defines the number of entities in one entity set, which can be associated with the number of entities of other set via relationship set." (e.g. 1:1, M:M, 1:M, M:1)
# "The association among entities is called a relationship."
# "Key is an attribute or collection of attributes that uniquely identifies an entity among entity set."
# "Entities are represented by means of their properties, called attributes."
# "An entity set is a collection of similar types of entities."

# Data definition statements
# "These [DDL] statements can declare, rename, modify, or destroy objects in the local database." (e.g. CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE)

# Data manipulation statements
# "These [DML] statements can retrieve, insert, delete, or modify data values." (e.g. SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

# Data Control Language 
# "DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deals with the rights, permissions and other controls of the database system." (e.g. GRANT, REVOKE)

# Transaction Control Language
# "TCL commands deals with the transaction within the database." (e.g. COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT)
